Problem Statement

You will be given data for N students, where each student will have a name (nm), class (cls), section (s), student ID (id), math marks (math_marks), and English marks (eng_marks).

Your task is to sort the students data according to the eng_marks in descending order. If multiple student have the same eng_marks then sort them according to the math_marks in descending order. If multiple student have the same math_marks then sort them accoding to the id in ascending order as the id will be unique.

Input Format

First line will contain N.
Next N lines will contain nm, cls, s, id, math_marks and eng_marks respectively.
Constraints

1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= |nm| <= 100 and will contain only English alphabets.
1 <= cls <= 10
'A' <= s <= 'Z'
1 <= id <= 10^9
0 <= math_marks, eng_marks <= 100
Output Format

Output the data in sorted order as instructed.
